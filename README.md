# ShapeRave
This is Shape Rave.
The idea behind it was to create a purely visual and interactive experience on which you can cause an effect to basic shapes and their actions. There was two concepts I wanted to work with to transmit this idea and you will be noticing when playing with the scene: wave effect and color blending. By wave effect I mean an interaction with something that will cause a propagation effect to other things around. And color blending is basically mixing the colors of two layers with a certain method (Add, Multiply, Screen and many others).
